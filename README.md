# MondrianAlgorithm

Here is the algorithm to generate a painting in the style of Mondrian. The algorithm is implemented in Python. 

The program isn't finished yet.

Based on this picture with the following parameters we have 

- scale = 40

- resizevalue = 1

- cleanvalue = 20

- marge = 60

By lowering the scale we get a picture which looks a bit more like the original picture compared to the previous result

- scale = 20

- resizevalue = 1  

- cleanvalue = 20

- marge = 60
